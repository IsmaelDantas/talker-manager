# Talker-Manager (Node.js)

## Introduction
In this project, me and the trybe students were asked to develop a **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing speakers for an event using Node.js and Express.js. This work aimed to develop our skills in creating different **endpoints** and **middlewares**.

## Main used technologies:
Node.js

Express.js

## Instructions to utilize the application
After cloning the repository, install the necessary dependencies with `npm install` command and start the project with `node index.js` command. After that, you can make requests using an HTTP client (Insomnia, Postman, HTTPie, etc.).
